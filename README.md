Python script that automatically decrypts ps3 isos using ps3dec

Download ps3dec https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1456/

PS3Dec GitHub https://github.com/al3xtjames/PS3Dec

Get decryption keys here https://ps3.aldostools.org/dkey.html

LINUX VERSION NOT TESTED!!

This script uses the older version that is made with C, the rust fork is not supported since it has different syntax

You have to manually change the paths for isos and ps3dec.

Keys.txt is useless

Made with AI for my personal use but wanted to put it public
