Python script that automatically decrypts ps3 isos using ps3dec

Download ps3dec https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/1456/

PS3Dec GitHub https://github.com/al3xtjames/PS3Dec

This script uses the older version that is made with C, the rust fork is not supported since it has different syntax

For now script is only for my own use and works only on windows and you have to manually change the paths for isos and ps3dec.
